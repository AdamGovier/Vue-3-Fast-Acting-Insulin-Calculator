# Bolus-Calculator
Open Source fast acting insulin (Bolus) dosage calculator app.

## Current Status
I am working on porting the original Bolus-Calculator https://github.com/AdamGovier/Bolus-Calculator written  without a front-end framework (Apache Cordova was used however to compile into a mobile app.) to Vue 3 & Capacitor. This will most likely be a long process so expect many of the original features not to be implemented as of right now.

The application is currently not operational.

Instructions to compile will come in the near future.

### Why port to Vue 3 
I want this project to be the best I can possibly make it. The move over to Vue will allow a more maintainable codebase allowing me to update the app without the need of digging through spaghetti code.

On top of porting over everything to Vue I need to actually finish the project so this will not be finished any time soon.

### Planned features & features took from the original project.
* iOS & Android support through Ionic Capacitor.
* Functional Bolus Calculator.
* Custom dosage modifiers.
* Sickness calculations.
* Meal Hotshots (A quick menu for counting carbohydrates).
* Correction calculations.
* Lot's more!
