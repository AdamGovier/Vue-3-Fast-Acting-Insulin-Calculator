## Current Status

The application is not ready for general use.

### Finished:

* ‚úÖ Original [Bolus-Calculator](https://github.com/AdamGovier/Bolus-Calculator) fully ported to Vue & Ionic.
* ‚úÖ Many new features added.
* ‚úÖ Base application almost finished.

### Underworks:

* üß™ E2E testing needs to be caried out.
* üßë‚ÄçüöÄ Personal testing (I will test the application on myself).
* üë™ User testing (An alpha test with a select user-group.).

Once the above is finished I plan to continue to add features to the application through the use of application updates.

### Planned future features:

* Companion app for friends & family to be able to monitor your data.
* A web view of your data for clinics.

### Why port to Vue 3

I want this project to be the best I can possibly make it. The move over to Vue will allow a more maintainable codebase allowing me to update the app without the need of digging through spaghetti code.

On top of porting over everything to Vue I need to actually finish the project so this will not be finished any time soon.
